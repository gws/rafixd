This program was initially developed by the KAME project.

http://www.kame.net/

The project can be found on Github (among other places):

http://github.com/kame/kame

The original BSD-only source on which this project is based is located here:

The program was initially ported to GNU/Linux by Eric Vyncke
(evyncke@cisco.com) in January 2008. It has since been updated by Gordon
Stratton (gordon.stratton@gmail.com) to continue to build on modern GNU/Linux
systems.

There are now two makefiles:

- Makefile: the original makefile
- Makefile.linux: a modified makefile for
  GNU/Linux

On a GNU/Linux system, you will use:

make -f Makefile.linux

and on BSD (maybe other?) systems, the usual 'make' should suffice.
