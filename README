This program has been initially developped by the KAME project:
http://orange.kame.net/dev/cvsweb2.cgi/kame/kame/kame/rafixd/

And has been ported to Linux by Eric Vyncke evyncke@cisco.com. January 2008.

There are two Makefile:
Makefile: the original one
Makefile.linux: the modified one (mainly defining a compile constant)

So, on a Linux system, you need to use:
make -f Makefile.linux

NOTE: while this utility appears to work as described (sending a RA
with lifetime=0 for the router), it does not appear to make a real
effect on Windows XP stations...
